        <h2>My Balinese Name </h2>
        <p>
            My complete name is I Made Soma. In case, you are not familiar with Balinese names, 
            it&#8217;s pronounced EE Ma:d√© Soma:. In Balinese culture, &#8220;I&#8221; 
            is given to a boy indicating a male child. &#8220;Made&#8221; 
            is given to a second born child. As you can imagine, 
            there are loads of other people in Bali who share this name. 
            For simplicity and to avoid confusion, I go by Soma. 
        </p>

        
        <h2>What I do </h2>
        <p>I describe myself as an educator, an edupreneur, and a lifelong learner. 
            I started my teaching career since I got my Bachelor&#8217;s degree in education back in 2012. 
            I worked in two language schools teaching Indonesian and English for foreign speakers. 
            Later on the same year, I joined the <a href="https://www.greenschool.org/bali/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green School Bali</a> 
            and stayed for 5 years. Some positions I held during my time there were high school Indonesian teacher, 
            primary classroom teacher, English teacher, and Indonesian curriculum developer and trainer. 
        </p>
        
        <p>In 2019, after coming back my master study in the United Kingdom, I embarked on an edupreneurship journey. 
            Along with likeminded teacher friends, I founded the <a href="https://jembatanbahasa.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jembatan Bahasa</a>, 
            an Indonesian language school for international learners and <a href="https://jbenglishbali.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                JB English</a>, an English training center for international and Indonesian learners. 
                In addition to this, I also work as a part-time lecturer at Mahasaraswati University in Denpasar. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I earned my bachelor&#8217;s degree in education majoring in English education from Mahasaraswati University. 
            Then, I continued my master&#8217;s degree in project management in Anglia Ruskin University, England. 
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies </h2>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, reading, traveling and watching movies.&nbsp;</p>
